I am an Artificial Intelligence Researcher and a student at Endicott College of International Studies at WOOSONG UNIVERSITY. I direct the Cybersecurity Club, where students learn about Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking, and I am also an active researcher.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, etc.

Previously, I obtained my Certification in Advanced Cybersecurity (CACS) in Computer Forensics from CYBERX TECHNOLOGIES, and my Education in Artificial Intelligence from Woosong University.
